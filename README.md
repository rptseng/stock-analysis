# VBA Stock Analysis

## Purpose and Overview
Steve is looking to efficiently use an Excel workbook macro to analyze the total volume and growth of various stock data from the years 2017 and 2018. Using a previously written VBA script for this task, we will refactor the code with the use of arrays to determine whether or not the VBA script can be run faster.

## Results

### Original Script Run Time
The original script before refactoring with arrays had a run time of 0.901 seconds for the year "2017" 0.905 seconds for the year "2018"

### Refactored Script Run Time
The refactored script had a run time of 0.192 seconds for the year "2017" and 0.187 seconds for the year "2018". On both runs, the refactored code compared to the original code was faster by roughly 0.7 seconds.
