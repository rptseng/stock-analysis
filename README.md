# VBA Stock Analysis

##Purpose and Overview
Steve is looking to efficiently use an Excel workbook macro to analyze the total volume and growth of various stock data from the years 2017 and 2018. Using a previously written VBA script for this task, we will refactor the code with the use of arrays to determine whether or not the VBA script can be run faster.
